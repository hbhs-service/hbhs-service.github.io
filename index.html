        <h1>Hamilton Boys' High School Service</h1>
        <p>Service is an integral part of the Hamilton Boys’ High School community and a strong service ethic is an impressive quality 
        that students can carry with them for the rest of their life. Within Hamilton Boys’ High School there are a number of service 
        events students can participate in to give back to the community - these can count towards the school’s service award scheme 
        which is a way of recognising students for the service they provide within the school as well as in the wider community.</p>
        <p>This website will detail the service award scheme that runs within the school, as well as providing descriptions of the 
        different annual events run by the school’s Service Committee. There are also examples of service students can give within the 
        school and wider community, and there is a section with a calendar of upcoming service events and notices so students may be 
        made aware of important dates that they may be interested in.</p>
