        <h1>Hamilton Boys' High School Service</h1>
        <p>This website is here to help students learn about service within the school, so more boys are motivated to help out within 
        their community and develop a strong sense of service themselves. This website also gives an overview of the school's 
        service award scheme, in order to help students be recognised for their service and willingness to contribute to the school and 
        wider community.</p>
