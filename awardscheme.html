        <h1>Service Award Scheme</h1>
        <p>The service award scheme at Hamilton Boys’ High School is split into three sections: Bronze, Silver and Gold. For each 
        section of the award students are required to complete a set number of hours:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For the Bronze award students must complete 40 hours of service</li>
          <li>For the Silver award students must complete 80 hours of service</li>
          <li>For the Gold award students must complete 100 hours of service</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After the three stages of the award, there is a Platinum award given out once a year for someone in Year 13 who
        has demonstrated exemplary service throughout their time at Hamilton Boys’ High School.</p>
        <p>Those interested in participating in the award scheme must purchase a service booklet from the school shop and write down the 
        type of service given and the number of hours, then get this signed off by a supervisor or someone involved with the type of service
        given by the student.</p>
        <p>Service Committee prefects are in the Study Centre every Wednesday morning during registration and students can bring 
        their booklets in each week to get the hours logged, so that they can receive an award. Awards are generally given out in assemblies 
        in Term 4.</p>
        <p>In addition to the school service award scheme, students may also credit service hours they have completed towards the Duke of 
        Edinburgh's Hillary (or Duke of Edinburgh) Award, a scheme that encourages personal development and character building through the 
        completion of service, learning a new skill, playing a sport and completing a number of adventurous journeys.</p>
