        <h1>Service Award Scheme</h1>
        <p>The service award scheme at Hamilton Boys’ High School is split into three sections: Bronze, Silver and Gold. For each 
        section of the award students are required to complete a set number of hours:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For the Bronze award students must complete 40 hours of service</li>
          <li>For the Silver award students must complete 80 hours of service</li>
          <li>For the Gold award students must complete 100 hours of service</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As well as the three stages of the award, there is a Platinum award given out once a year for a student in Year 13 who
        has demonstrated exemplary service throughout their time at Hamilton Boys’ High School.</p>
        <p>Students must purchase a service booklet from the school shop where they write down the type of service given and the 
        number of hours, then get this signed off by a supervisor or someone related to the type of service the student has given.</p>
        <p>Service Committee prefects are in the Study Centre every Wednesday morning during registration and students can bring 
        their booklets in each week to get the hours logged, so that they can receive an award. Awards are generally given out in assemblies 
        in Term 4.</p>
