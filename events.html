      <h1>Service Events at HBHS</h1>
      <h2>Blood Drives</h2>
      <p>Every year at Hamilton Boysâ€™ High School there are two Blood Drives, held in the school hall. This is an opportunity for 
      students to donate blood and help save the lives of those who urgently need it. Students who are aged 16 years or over at the
      time of donating blood are encouraged to sign up provided they weigh over 50kg and are on good health at the time of donation. 
      Students interested in donating blood should pay attention to the school notices so they can sign up for a donation.</p>
      <h2>KidsCan Charity Fun Run</h2>
      <p>The KidsCan Charity Fun Run is an event held annually on the last day of Term 1. The run starts at school and goes along the 
      riverbanks before returning to school. Students pay $5 to run and the money goes to KidsCan - a charity that provides essential 
      items such as warm clothing and shoes to New Zealand children living in poverty who are unable to afford these items.</p>
      <h2>The Great Dome Shave</h2>
      <p>Previously known as Shave for a Cure, this event is held at the end of Term 3 where students and teachers shave their heads to 
      raise money for (CHARITY). Those shaving set a price and if the school raises that amount of money, the participant will shave 
      their head at the lunchtime event in the school hall. Students can donate any amount of money and this is collected in tutor 
      groups during registration in the weeks leading up to the event.</p>
