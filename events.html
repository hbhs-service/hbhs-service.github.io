      <h2>Blood Drives</h2>
      <p>Every year at Hamilton Boysâ€™ High School there are two Blood Drives, held in the school hall and organised in conjunction with
      the <a href="http://www.nzblood.co.nz/">NZ Blood Service</a>. This is an opportunity for students to donate blood and help save 
      the lives of those who urgently need it. Students who are aged 16 years or over at the time of donating blood are encouraged to 
      sign up provided they weigh over 50kg and are in good health at the time of donation. Students interested in giving blood are 
      encouraged to pay attention to the school notices so they can sign up to donate.</p>

      <h2>KidsCan Charity Fun Run</h2>
      <p>The KidsCan Charity Fun Run is an event held annually on the last day of Term 1. The run starts at school and goes along the 
      banks of the Waikato river before returning to school. Students pay $5 to run and the money goes to <a href="https://www.kidscan.org.nz/">
      KidsCan</a> - a charity that provides essential items such as warm clothing and shoes to New Zealand children living in poverty 
      whose families are unable to afford these items themselves.</p>

      <h2>The Great Dome Shave</h2>
      <p>Previously known as Shave for a Cure, this event is held near the end of Term 3 where students and teachers shave their heads 
      to raise money for <a href="https://www.canteen.org.nz/">CanTeen</a>, a charity supporting New Zealand youths living with cancer. 
      Students can donate any amount of money and this is can be given to the school shop or in the hall on the day of the shave. The 
      event takes place in the school hall, where local hairdressers come in and shave the heads of the students and teachers who are 
      participating.</p>
