        <h1>Types of Service</h1>
        <p>There are a large number of activities students are able to do to give service to the school and the wider community. Many 
        students already give service in some form but are unaware of it, or are not signed up in the school award scheme so they are 
        unable to be recognised for the service they do provide. Below are a variety of service opportunities offered by either 
        Hamilton Boysâ€™ High School or by community organisations, or forms of service that students are able to complete themselves.</p>
